				<h1>Thanks for helping Tonto!</h1>

				<h1>Thank you from Samantha</h1>
				<p>Our sweet little kitten Samantha, began sleeping all the time and urinating excessively, so we brough her to see the specialists at Wisdom. After running a blood test Dr. Winthrop confirmed what we all feared- Samantha was showing signs of early diabetes.</p>

				<h1>Our grape-loving dog</h1>
				<p>The staff at Wisdom worked tirelessly to determine why our three-year old bulldog, Roxie, started going into sudden kidney failure. they stabilized her and provided fluids until her kidneys were again functiioning normal, but it was still a mystery as to what caused her health to decline so quickly.</p>

				<h1>A dog antibiotic cured our fish!</h1>
				<p>Wisdom Pet Medicine is the only jclinic arond that will even book pet fish for appointments. When our 13-year old goldfish, McAllister, turned from silvery white to an angry red, we called around, urgently trying to find a veterinarian who could help. Wisom not only got us in the same day, but also was anle to diagnose McAllister as having a severe case of septicemia.</p>
